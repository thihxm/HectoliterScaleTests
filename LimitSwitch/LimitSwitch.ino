  Button

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13,
  when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.

  The circuit:
  - LED attached from pin 13 to ground through 220 ohm resistor
  - pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  - 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

  - Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
    attached to pin 13.

// constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
const int LED_PIN = 2;
const int BUTTON_PIN = 15;  // the number of the pushbutton pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;  // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial)
    delay(10); // will pause Zero, Leonardo, etc until serial console opens
  // Verificar se o pino tem resistencia interna. Estava com o pino 2 e ele n√£o tinha
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(BUTTON_PIN, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_PIN);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  Serial.print("Estado do botao: ");
  Serial.println(buttonState == HIGH);
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, buttonState == HIGH);
